		 - Tumblr blog name
2)Update the meta.json file with your data specifying:

		 - Text describing when the publication will be delivered 
			(twice a week, every day, on solstice :) );
		 - Email address
3)Customize the images icon.png/banner.png
4)Update the file .htacces (on Mac the file is invisible) replacing 'tumblr_lp' with the relative path of the publication folder on the server
